This page outlines PARADISEC's approach to digitising text materials. The majority of our fieldnotes, papers, and notebook digitisation is done with high resolution photography, not scanning. Here are some reasons why we choose to use photography rather than scanning:

* the process is much faster
* items that are very fragile or have different shapes are easily accomodated with less handling
* this method will capture very high quality images with correct colour representation
* the equipment is portable and can easily be set up in most environments, including remote field locations with tricky power options
* depending on your equipment choices, this can be the least expensive option, yet will still retain high quality output

### Cameras
#### Canon PowerShot G12
We purchased this Canon camera in 2010 and it is still fully functional in 2021. It is a compact digital camera, not a DSLR. The PowerShot allows you to capture RAW images without JPEG compression, as well as JPEGs, or both simultaneously. This model does not allow for tethering without some [hacking](https://chdk.fandom.com/wiki/CHDK_1.4.0_User_Manual) of the firmware. I have not done this hack; I have developed a very functional workflow for image capture without remote capture. Another nice feature of this camera is the articulated LCD screen. You can rotate it so that your image is visible from a seated position when the camera lens is pointed downwards on a desk or table in front of you.

#### Canon EOS 700D
This DSLR *does* allow remote capture tethering. This opens up the possibility of attaching the camera to a computer to view, focus, and capture images and store them directly on your computer, with a predertermined file-naming pattern. But you can also use the same workflow as the non-tethering compact digital camera if you do not have a computer handy at the time of digitising. This model also features an articulated LCD monitor for comfortable image viewing. Another bonus with this camera is that you can do quick zoom adjustments by manually adjusting the lens, which you cannot do with the PowerShot.

> **Note:** If you are going to be taking photos in a remote area with unpredictable access to a power source, you may need to pair a [portable solar pannel and power bank](https://powertraveller.com/collections/power-packs) with a [universal battery charger](https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/au/buying-guides/the-best-universal-charger-for-your-camera-batteries) to charge your camera's battery

### Tripods and photo stands
#### Velbon Sherpa 803R
We purchased this tripod about ten years ago, so you will likely not find the exact model. But the important features on this tripod are the following:
* reversable centre post (necessary for this workflow)
* relatively compact and lightweight
* spirit level (not necessary, but nice to have)

</p>

This tripod came with the shelf clamp accessory, but you can purchase this separately. If you do, make sure there is a tripod post that comes with the clamp if you do not already have a tripod with a removable centre post. The link in the table above directs you to a similar model to the shelf clamp that came with our Velbon Sherpa 803R.

#### Kaiser Reprokid Photo Stand
The Reprokid model is a compact camera stand that can accommodate small, lightweight cameras. It works really well with either of the above Canon cameras. This photo stand came with the lighting set, so one does not need to figure out where to attach any lighting. The vertical post is ruled so you can retrieve the distance of the lens to the target, or just make note of the camera placement for quick set up the next time you shoot. The base is a hard plastic grey surface so I use black matte card stock under my items. You can place a ruler or a [colour separation guide and grey scales patch](https://www.kodak.com/en/motion/page/color-separation-guides-and-gray-scales) on the base if you need this level of size or colour precision in your image capture.

## Setting up the equipment

### Using a tripod with reversable centre post
This is a great set-up beacuse it is the least expensive and the most versatile, especially if you need to photograph items in a remote location. The tricky part is getting the lighting right. Your light source (natural or artificial) could be blocked by the tripod legs and cast a shadow on your image. If your light source is in a fixed position, try moving the tripod around to minimise any shadows. You may also try to find lights that you can clip on to the legs of your tripod or onto nearby furniture. Just be mindful that too much direct, unfiltered lighting may wash out your image. I try to find a light coloured wall I can place the tripod next to and then shine the lights onto the wall. The reflected light is usually enough to provide evenly disrtributed indirecrt lighting.

### Using a shelf clamp
Using just the shelf clamp and the tripod's centre post is by far my favourite combination, especially if there is any travel involved. The only drawback is that this requires a shelf that you can clamp to. However, if you are in a very remote location you could construct something with timber, bamboo, or even a smooth, sturdy branch. Just make sure it is strong and secure enough to hold your camera and allows you to create consistant images. 

Below are two configurations with the shelf clamp and an actual shelf (no need for bamboo this time). The image on the left is with the Canon EOS 700D tethered to a laptop for remote capture. The image on the right is the Canon PowerShot; images are being captured to the camera's SD card. 

>**Note:** The lights are directed to the wall, not on the tape or notebook. This creates enough reflected light for the photos. When you review your images after your shoot and find that you would like them to be a bit lighter after all, you can batch edit the lighting using Adobe Bridge (discussed below).

### Using a photo stand
Photo stands have many benefits for image capture. This particular model has the lighting attached, as noted above you don't have to worry about where to clamp the lights. The light fixtures on this stand can move around, so if the light is too direct and overpowering, they can turn so that they are pointing away or toward the back wall. Be mindful of the cables from the lights; if you don't tie them up and out of the way, they can show up in an image, or cast a shadow on your subject.

Having the camera attached to a stable, ruled post is great for keeping your set-up consistant from day to day. If you need to shift things around in your space, the entire set-up can be moved as is. Having a solid base on which to put your notebooks or documents is also a fine feature. The base on this model is a bit small. If you need to build up the base to create an expanded, level for larger notebooks to fit, perhaps place some books you may have nearby around the photostand's base to create an enlarged, even platform. Or get a piece of plywood and clamp it to the photo stand base.

The downside to using a photo stand is the cost. Pricing for these can be a bit expensive. The Reprokid is one of Kaiser's less expensive models and it works very well for our purposes.

## Software

### Remote capture: EOS Utility (if using compatible Canon camera)
If you are using a Canon camera that is compatible with the EOS Utility software, you can choose to remotely capture images to a tethered computer. This software works for both [PCs](https://www.canon.com.au/support/sims-content?pid=74c2eb672e2946a7b940f86e2c9e2461&cid=3E70ECD154334FBD866C212BDC988F56&ctype=ap) and [Macs](https://www.canon.com.au/support/sims-content?pid=0a6e29c7259d4fa8938b3bb591ebb372&cid=A5B1C6A24B9D464DBCFE41EEE51ECAD3&ctype=ap). It can speed up your task of taking photos if you set up a good workflow. 

### Image preview and processing: Adobe Bridge
As you capture the images, it is important to take a look at your images before you get too far into your task. That said, at the end of the day, if you have collected 1,000 photos and you realise that you would like to crop them, or that the lighting was a bit too warm and you need to cool the colours a bit, you can use Bridge to do this rather quickly.
